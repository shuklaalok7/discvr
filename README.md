#Sample Classes
Classes are designed for Discvr android application. This is for personal use, I request not to fork it.
## For Akshay
* Please take a check-out and import as a Maven project.
* I have used `@Getter`/`@Setter` annotations from `Lombok` to mark that the getters and setters are present.
* Please install Lombok plugin for your IDE, if not already installed.
* I have used new Date/Time API introduced in Java 8 hence please set the IDE to be Java 1.8.
